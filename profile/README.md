# Uranometrical
A group of people working to create a fun little MC modding project.

Our main focus is _Constellar_, a Minecraft 1.8.9. PvP client targeting standalone functionality, with support for Forge through tweaking (the same way OptiFine works).

### Constellar
A small project aiming to develop into a respectable mod to use alongside other mods, with many features from other popular clients such as _Lunar Client_, and some more miscellaneous modules from mods such as _LabyMod_. We are not developing Constellar with the goal of replacing any existing mods, and our main goal is to expand outward into focusing on servers aside from _Hypixel_.

# Uranometrical
The organization behind _Constellar_, _Aurora_, and more. We're a group of friends working to create fun little MC modding-related projects.

Our main focuses are:
 * _Constellar_, a Minecraft 1.8.9. PvP client targeting standalone and forge functionality, powered by SpongePowered Mixins.
 * _Aurora_, an extensible launcher alternative, and will be _Constellar_'s main launcher in the future.
 * _notes_, reverse-engineered documentation of other clients and mods, as well as articles about client and mod development.

### Constellar
A small client project aiming to develop into a respectable standalone PvP client. Functions as a standalone mod (such as Lunar Client, Badlion, etc.), as well as a Forge mod (such as LabyMod). The goal is to merge plenty of features from other clients using our own, unique implementations. We also aim to feature compatibility with the cosmetics of other clients, as well as their networking, though this is quite ambitious -- no promises!

_Constellar_ focuses on more than just Hypixel, as well.

### notes
Reverse-engineered documentation on other clients and mods, hence the slow progress. Also contains information on client and mod development, aims to be informative.

### Aurora (TODO)
An extensible C#/.NET 5.0 Minecraft launcher built on top of osu!framework, with the goal of being entirely plug-in-based and being capable of launching other PvP clients, such as Lunar and Badlion.
